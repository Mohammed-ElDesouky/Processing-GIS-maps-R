The purpose of the project is to create a light intensity map for India through processing "Shape" &  "Raster" files

### [please note] the shape file is included in the project's folder, but not the raster data files due to its sizable size -- but his information is readily available online for a download free of charge. Just search "light intensity raster data for India"
